DELETE THE routes.json FILE

Since we are now using vercel.json with the "rewrites" configuration, you should delete the routes.json file before deployment.

The vercel.json file properly configures the SPA routing with:
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}

This configuration tells Vercel to serve the index.html file for all routes, allowing your React Router to handle client-side routing correctly.
